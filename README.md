# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for PyBer. 
I used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
The written report below, summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

**What the data shows for Urban cities**
- Urban  cities had a total of 1,625 rides between January-May(8th)2019. This accounted for 68.4% of all rides (2,375). 
- Urban cities accounted for 62.7% ($39,854.38) of the total fares ($63,538.64).  
- Total Urban drivers = 2,405 of the 2,973 total. 80.9% of the drivers are in the Urban cities. 

There are more available drivers than there were rides. 

**What the data shows for Suburban cities**
- Suburban cities had a total of 625 rides, accounting for 26.3% of all rides.
- Suburban cities total fares were $19,356.33. This accounted for 30.5% of the combined fares. 
- Suburban cities total drivers = 490, 16.5% of the total drivers.

Suburban cities have the potential to bring in the more money for PyBer.

**What the data shows for Rural cities**
- Rural cities account for less than 7% of the total rides, total fares, and total drivers for Pyber. Rural cities only accounted for $4,327.93 of the total fares.  
- The average fare per ride was $34.62. This is $10.00 more than the average Urban city ride.

**Some recommendations**
- You should try to increase the amount of rides in all areas as you have enough drivers available to do so. 
- You should try increasing the amount of rides in suburban cities as the average fare is $30.97, where the average in Urban cities is $24.53.
