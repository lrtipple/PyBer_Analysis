# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for PyBer. 
I used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
The written report below, summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
